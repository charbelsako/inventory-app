[*] figure out how to make a layout file *PROPERLY*

[ ] Make the add to cart button work
[ ] Write a procedure or function to handle checkout

[ ] Add a users table??
[ ] Add an item view to view single items with their price history

### Needed for project deployment

[ ] The cart should display the appropriate number of items no the quantity. Should be easy with group by.
[ ] Add the total of the cart. Again, should be easy with the sum function.

[*] Change your api to start to use /api for adding and getting from the database and use / to GET
the data by requesting the api.

[ ] handle errors (express validator)

[ ] Make views/procedures for your long queries WIP
  [*] - fix error of single quotes

convert date to utc (I don't think I have to..)
[*] check node-postgres documentation for function to handle parameters (check queryWithValues function)
